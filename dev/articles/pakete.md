# Why pakete?

In Filipino, **pakete** (pronounced */pa.ke.te/*) is our word for
package. My main motivation for `pakete` is to serve as my personal
utility tool for package development. There are amazing packages such as
`usethis` and `devtools` that provide functions that facilitate the
implementation of the different steps needed in package development.
However, there are other small tasks not covered by any of these
packages that I find myself performing repetitively in my package
development workflow.
