In Filipino, **pakete** (pronounced */pa.ke.te/*) is our word for package. My main motivation for `pakete` is to serve as my personal utility tool for package development. There are amazing packages such as `usethis` and `devtools` that provide functions that facilitate the implementation of the different steps needed in package development. However, there are other small tasks not covered by any of these packages that I find myself performing repetitively in my package development workflow.
