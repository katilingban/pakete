Tools and utilities for package development currently not available from
usual development tools. These are mostly linked to personal preferences
during the development process. They assist in making routine and
repetitive tasks easily implementable.

## What does `pakete` do?

Currently, `pakete` includes functions for:

1.  creating GitHub checklists for tasks in the package submission
    process;

2.  creating `_pkgdown.yml` templates for projects that I work on;

3.  creating `CONTRIBUTING.md` file;

4.  adding `repostatus` badge; and,

5.  adding Zenodo DOI badge.

## Installation

You can install `pakete` via the [Katilingban
R-universe](https://katilingban.r-universe.dev) as follows:

``` r
install.packages(
  "pakete",
  repos = c('https://katilingban.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org')
)
```
